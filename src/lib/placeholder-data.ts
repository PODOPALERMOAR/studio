        <p>Proper footwear is the foundation of good posture and overall well-being. Many common ailments, from back pain to headaches, can be traced back to wearing ill-fitting or unsupportive shoes. In this post, we'll explore the key elements of a good shoe and provide tips for your next shopping trip.</p>
        <h3 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Arch Support</h3>
        <p>Your feet have natural arches that absorb shock. Shoes with good arch support help maintain this structure, reducing strain on your feet, ankles, and knees.</p>
        <h3 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Proper Sizing</h3>
        <p>Always measure your feet before buying new shoes, as sizes can vary between brands. There should be about a thumb's width of space between your longest toe and the end of the shoe.</p>
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic my-4">"The greatest wealth is health." - Virgil</blockquote>
        <p>Investing in good footwear is an investment in your long-term health. Don't compromise on quality for the sake of fashion.</p>

        <p>Foot pain can be debilitating, but many common issues are treatable. Here are five problems we frequently see in our clinic:</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 my-4">
          <li><strong>Bunions:</strong> A bony bump at the base of the big toe. Often caused by tight shoes. Solution: Wider shoes, padding, or in severe cases, surgery.</li>
          <li><strong>Plantar Fasciitis:</strong> Heel pain, especially in the morning. Solution: Stretching, supportive shoes, and physical therapy.</li>
          <li><strong>Ingrown Toenails:</strong> Painful condition where the nail grows into the skin. Solution: Proper trimming, soaking, and sometimes professional removal.</li>
          <li><strong>Fungal Infections:</strong> Itchy, scaly skin, often between the toes (Athlete's Foot). Solution: Antifungal creams and keeping feet dry.</li>
          <li><strong>Corns and Calluses:</strong> Thick, hardened layers of skin. Solution: Soaking, moisturizing, and removing the source of friction.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you're experiencing persistent foot pain, it's always best to consult a professional podiatrist.</p>
